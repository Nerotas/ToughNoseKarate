 * Each technique builds upon previous belt levels, showing increasing complexity:
 * - Green White Belt: Basic techniques and principles
 * - Green Belt: Intermediate variations building on Green White foundations
 * - Green Black Belt: Advanced applications with multiple options
 * - Brown White Belt: Master-level techniques integrating all previous knowledge
 *
 * Students must demonstrate mastery of basic techniques before progressing to
 * advanced variations. Safety and proper supervision are paramount.
